Notes on packaging this application as a jar file to be used anywhere

1) In VS Code using maven package I can package this application into an executable jar. This requires modifying the pom though which I have already done.
    Specifically, it only involved adding one category for maven jar plugin and manifest setting. The manifiest file is what the jvm looks for when we run
    the jar file using the command >java [vm-args] -jar /path/to/jar. The manifest file gets packaged into the jar.

2) Icon viewing on linux (GNOME Fedora in my case) may not be working. Since the eventual goal is to install the app as a standalone application and not
   launch from vs code, I created a .desktop file and placed it in the ~/.local/share/applications dir.

3) Since I want the jar to be executable and not type the full command, I put it into an sh file and for now have placed it into Desktop/ETTest. Eventually,
   I imagine this will go along in a dir along with the jar file and the .desktop should get execute this sh file from that location. Once I determine which 
   location on linux to install this jar, then it should be more clear how to structure this all.

4) Since I am able to run this as a standalone desktop appplication, I noticed that the data.bin file moves to the user home dir, whatever that is defined for
   an OS. This should be eventually changed to use the install dir location of this application. TBD on how to do this or at least rename it to ExpenseTrackerData.bin
   so that a user knows it is not a suspicious file.
